This is the GeoData class for Python.

Style Guide:

his style guide will cover conventions and elements specific to this codebase. For more general tips on proper Python style guidelines see PEP 8 the de-facto Python style guide (http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

The code is broken up into the following directories: GeoData, Utilities, Read. GeoData holds code related to the GeoData class such as the class def file and any other functions that directly use or impact the class. The folder Utilities holds code related to functions that would be used to support the class such as coordinate transforms. Lastly the Reading directory is to be used to store functions that will be used to read in data from new data types.

The read functions will be placed in the Reading folder and be within a specific file. The names of the functions will start with read_ and then followed by a descriptive name.

Code that impacts the class will be placed in the class def file. For example if it is desired to interpolate the data to a different set of coordinates this should be implemented as a method in the class. The code for doing this can be written outside of the class def file if needed but this should only be done to keep the code neat.

The properties names will be all lower case. While all function names will be lower case with _ to separate words. The classes will be have capitalized words with no spaces. Directories will be capitalized with _ to separate words.

If the user would like to create test code please do this in the Test folder. Also this code is not be uploaded to the main code base on GitHub.
